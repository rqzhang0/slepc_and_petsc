.. _`Luc Berger-Vergiat`:

.. topic:: *Luc Berger-Vergiat*, **Using Kokkos Ecosystem with PETSc on modern architectures**

    Supercomputers increasingly rely on GPUs to achieve high
    throughput while maintaining a reasonable power consumption. Consequently,
    scientific applications are adapting to this new environment, and new
    algorithms are designed to leverage the high concurrency of GPUs. In this
    presentation, I will show how the Kokkos Ecosystem can help alleviate some
    of the difficulties associated with support for multiple CPU/GPU
    architectures. I will also show some results using the Kokkos and Kokkos
    kernels libraries with PETSc on modern architectures.

.. _`Blaise Bourdin`:

.. topic:: *Blaise Bourdin*, **From the trenches: porting mef90**

    mef90 is a distributed three-dimensional unstructured finite-element
    implementation of various phase-field models of fracture. In this talk,
    I will share the experience gained while porting mef90 from petsc 3.3 to 3.18.

.. _`Sara Calandrini`:

.. topic:: *Sara Calandrini*, Darren Engwirda, Luke Van Roekel, **A new non-hydrostatic capability for MPAS-Ocean**

    The Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean (MPAS-Ocean) is an
    open-source, global ocean model and is one component within the Department
    of Energy’s E3SM framework, which includes atmosphere, sea ice, and
    land-ice models. In this work, a new formulation for the ocean model is
    presented that solves the non-hydrostatic, incompressible Boussinesq
    equations on unstructured meshes. The introduction of this non-hydrostatic
    capability is necessary for the representation of fine-scale dynamical
    processes, including resolution of internal wave dynamics and large eddy
    simulations. Compared to the standard hydrostatic formulation,
    a non-hydrostatic pressure solver and a vertical momentum equation are
    added, where the PETSc (Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
    Computation) library is used for the inversion of a large sparse system for
    the nonhydrostatic pressure. Numerical results comparing the solutions of
    the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models are presented, and the parallel
    efficiency and accuracy of the time-stepper are evaluated.

.. _`Justin Chang`:

.. topic:: *Justin Chang*, **AMD GPU benchmarking, documentation, and roadmap**

    This talk comprises three parts. First, we present an overview of some
    relatively new training documentation like the "AMD lab notes" to enable
    current and potential users of AMD GPUs into getting the best experience
    out of their applications or algorithms. Second, we briefly discuss
    implementation details regarding the PETSc HIP backend introduced into the
    PETSc library late last year and present some performance benchmarking data
    on some of the AMD hardware. Lastly, we give a preview of the upcoming
    MI300 series APU and how software developers can prepare to leverage this
    new type of accelerator.

.. _`Mohamad Ibrahim Cheikh`:

.. topic:: *Mohamad Ibrahim Cheikh*, Konstantin Doubrovinski, **An Immersed Boundary method for Elastic Bodies Using PETSc**

    This study presents a parallel implementation of an immersed boundary
    method code using the PETSc distributed memory module. This work aims to simulate a complex developmental process that occurs in the
    early stages of embryonic development, which involves the transformation of
    the embryo into a multilayered and multidimensional structure. To
    accomplish this, the researchers used the PETSc parallel module to solve
    a linear system for the Eulerian fluid dynamics while simultaneously
    coupling it with a deforming Lagrangian elastic body to model the
    deformable embryonic tissue. This approach allows for a detailed simulation
    of the interaction between the fluid and the tissue, which is critical for
    accurately modeling the developmental process. Overall, this work
    highlights the potential of the immersed boundary method and parallel
    computing techniques for simulating complex physical phenomena.

.. _`Jacob Faibussowitsch`:

.. topic:: *Jacob Faibussowitch*, **Transparent Asynchronous Compute Made Easy With PETSc**

    Asynchronous GPU computing has historically been difficult to integrate scalably at the library level. We provide an update on recent work
    implementing a fully asynchronous framework in PETSc. We give detailed
    performance comparisons and provide a demo to showcase the proposed model's effectiveness
    and ease of use.

.. _`Daniel Finn`:

.. topic:: *Daniel Finn*, **PETSc-PIC: A Structure-Preserving Particle-In-Cell Method for Electrostatic Solves**

    Numerical solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson equations have important
    applications in the fields of plasma physics, solar physics, and cosmology.
    The goal of this research is to develop a structure-preserving,
    electrostatic and gravitational Vlasov-Poisson(-Landau) model using the
    Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) and study
    the presence of Landau damping in a variety of systems, such as
    thermonuclear fusion reactors and galactic dynamics. The PETSc
    Particle-In-Cell (PETSc-PIC) model is a highly scalable,
    structure-preserving PIC method with multigrid capabilities. In the PIC
    method, a hybrid discretization is constructed with a grid of finitely
    supported basis functions to represent the electric, magnetic, and/or
    gravitational fields, and a distribution of delta functions to represent
    the particle field. Collisions are added to the formulation using
    a particle-basis Landau collision operator recently added to the PETSc
    library.

.. _`Derek Gaston`:

.. topic:: *Derek Gaston*, **Multiscale, Multiphysics Simulation Through Application Composition Using MOOSE**

    Eight years ago, at the PETSc 20 meeting, I introduced the idea of
    "Simplifying Multiphysics Through Application Composition" -- the idea
    that physics applications can be built in such a way that they can
    instantly be combined to tackle complicated multiphysics problems.
    This talk will serve as an update on those plans.  I will detail the
    evolution of that idea, how we’re using it in practice, how well it’s
    working, and where we’re going next.  Motivating examples will be drawn
    from nuclear engineering, and practical aspects, such as testing, will
    be explored.

.. _`Alex Grant`:

.. topic:: *Alex Grant*, Karthik Chockalingam, Xiaohu Guo, **High-order FEM implementation in AMReX using PETSc**

    AMReX is a C++ block-structured framework for adaptive mesh refinement,
    typically used for finite difference or finite volume codes.  We describe
    a first attempt at a finite element implementation in AMReX using PETSc.
    AMReX splits the domain of uniform elements into rectangular boxes at each
    refinement level, with higher levels overlapping rather than replacing
    lower levels and with each level solved independently.  AMReX boxes can be
    cell-centered or nodal; we use cell centered boxes to represent the geometry
    and mesh and nodal boxes to identify nodes to constrain and store results
    for visualization.  We convert AMReX’s independent spatial indices into
    a single global index, then use MATMPIAIJ to assemble the system matrix per
    refinement level.  In an unstructured grid, isoparametric mapping is
    required for each element; using a structured grid avoids both this
    and indirect addressing, which provides significant potential performance
    advantages.  We have solved time-dependent parabolic equations and seen
    performance gains compared to unstructured finite elements.  Further
    developments will include arbitrary higher-order schemes and
    multi-level hp refinement with arbitrary hanging nodes.  PETSc uses AMReX
    domain decomposition to partition the matrix and right-hand vectors.  For
    each higher level, not all of the domain will be refined, but AMReX’s
    indices cover the whole space - this poses an indexing challenge and can
    lead to over-allocation of memory.  It is still to be explored whether DM
    data structures would provide a benefit over MATMPIAIJ.

.. _`Aidan Hamilton`:

.. topic:: *Aidan Hamilton*, Jing-Mei Qiu, Hong Zhang, **Scalable Riemann Solvers with the Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Hyperbolic Network Simulation**

    We develop highly efficient and effective computational algorithms
    and simulation tools for fluid simulations on a network. The mathematical
    models are a set of hyperbolic conservation laws on the edges of a network, as
    well as coupling conditions on junctions of a network. For example, the
    shallow water system, together with flux balance and continuity conditions
    at river intersections, model water flows on a river network. The
    computationally accurate and robust discontinuous Galerkin methods,
    coupled with explicit strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta methods, are
    implemented for simulations on network edges. Meanwhile, linear and
    nonlinear scalable Riemann solvers are being developed and implemented at
    network vertices. These network simulations result in tools built using
    PETSc and DMNetwork software libraries for the scientific community in
    general. Simulation results of a shallow water system on a Mississippi
    river network with over one billion network variables are performed on an
    extreme- scale computer using up to 8,192 processors with an optimal
    parallel efficiency. Further potential applications include traffic flow
    simulations on a highway network and blood flow simulations on an arterial
    network, among many others

.. _`Zakariae Jorti`:

.. topic:: *Zakariae Jorti*, Qi Tang, Konstantin Lipnikov, Xianzhu Tang, **A mimetic finite difference based quasi-static magnetohydrodynamic solver for force-free plasmas in tokamak disruptions**

    Force-free plasmas are a good approximation in the low-beta case, where the
    plasma pressure is tiny compared with the magnetic pressure. On time scales
    long compared with the transit time of Alfvén waves, the evolution of
    a force-free plasma is most efficiently described by a quasi-static
    magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which ignores the plasma inertia. In this
    work, we consider a regularized quasi-static MHD model for force-free
    plasmas in tokamak disruptions and propose a mimetic finite difference
    (MFD) algorithm, which is targeted at applications such as the cold
    vertical displacement event (VDE) of a major disruption in an ITER-like
    tokamak reactor. In the case of whole device modeling, we further consider
    the two sub-domains of the plasma region and wall region and their coupling
    through an interface condition. We develop a parallel, fully implicit, and
    scalable MFD solver based on PETSc and its DMStag data structure to discretize the five-field quasi-static perpendicular plasma dynamics
    model on a 3D structured mesh. The MFD spatial discretization is coupled
    with a fully implicit DIRK scheme. The full algorithm exactly preserves the
    divergence-free condition of the magnetic field under a generalized Ohm’s
    law. The preconditioner employed is a four-level fieldsplit preconditioner,
    created by combining separate preconditioners for individual
    fields, that calls multigrid or direct solvers for sub-blocks or exact
    factorization on the separate fields. The numerical results confirm the
    divergence-free constraint is strongly satisfied and demonstrate the
    performance of the fieldsplit preconditioner and overall algorithm. The
    simulation of ITER VDE cases over the actual plasma current diffusion time
    is also presented.

.. _`Jakub Kruzik`:

.. topic:: *Jakub Kruzik*, Marek Pecha, David Horak, **PERMON library for quadratic programming**

    PERMON (Parallel, Efficient, Robust, Modular, Object-oriented, Numerical)
    is a library based on PETSc for solving quadratic programming (QP)
    problems. We will present PERMON usage on our implementation of the FETI
    (finite element tearing and interconnecting) method. This FETI
    implementation involves a chain of QP transformations,  such as
    dualization, which simplifies a given QP. We will also discuss some useful
    options, like viewing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (optimality) conditions for each
    QP in the chain. Finally, we will showcase some QP applications solved by
    PERMON, such as the solution of contact problems for hydro-mechanical
    problems with discrete fracture networks or the solution of support vector
    machines using the PermonSVM module.

.. _`Vanessa Lopez-Marrero`:

.. topic:: *Vanessa Lopez-Marrero*, Kwangmin Yu, Tao Zhang, Mohammad Atif, Abdullah Al Muti Sharfuddin, Fan Yang, Yangang Liu, Meifeng Lin, Foluso Ladeinde, Lingda Li, **Towards enabling digital twins capabilities for a cloud chamber**

    Particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS), which resolve not
    only the smallest turbulent eddies but also track the development and
    the motion of individual particles, are an essential tool for studying
    aerosol-cloud-turbulence interactions.  For instance, PR-DNS may complement
    experimental facilities designed to study key physical processes in
    a controlled environment and therefore serve as digital twins for such
    cloud chambers.  In this talk, we will present our ongoing work aimed at
    enabling the use of PR-DNS for this purpose.  We will describe the physical
    model used, which consists of a set of fluid dynamics equations for
    air velocity, temperature, and humidity coupled with a set of equations
    for particle (i.e., droplet) growth/tracing.  The numerical method used to
    solve the model, which employs PETSc solvers in its implementation, will be
    discussed, as well as our current efforts to assess performance and
    scalability of the numerical solver.

.. _`David May`:

.. topic:: *David May*, **PETSc ROCKS**

    The field of Geodynamics is concerned with understanding
    the deformation history of the solid Earth over millions to billions of
    year time scales. The infeasibility of extracting a spatially and
    temporally complete geological record based on rocks that are currently
    exposed at the surface of the Earth compels many geodynamists to employ
    computational simulations of geological processes.

    In this presentation I will discuss several geodynamic software packages
    which utilize PETSc. I intend to highlight how PETSc has played an
    important role in enabling and advancing state-of-the-art in geodynamic
    software. I will also summarize my own experiences and observations of how
    geodynamic-specific functionality has driven the
    development of new general-purpose PETSc functionality.

.. _`Heeho Park`:

.. topic:: *Heeho Park*, Glenn Hammond, Albert Valocchi, **PETSc Newton Trust-Region for Simulating Large-scale Engineered Subsurface Systems with PFLOTRAN**

    Modeling large-scale engineered subsurface systems entails significant
    additional numerical challenges. For nuclear waste repository, the
    challenges arise from: (a) the need to accurately represent both the waste
    form processes and shafts, tunnel, and barriers at the small spatial scale
    and the large-scale transport processes throughout geological formations;
    (b) the strong contrast in material properties such as porosity and
    permeability, and the nonlinear constitutive relations for multiphase flow;
    (c) the decay of high level nuclear wastes cause nearby water to boil off
    into steam leading to dry-out. These can lead to an ill-conditioned
    Jacobian matrix and non-convergence with Newton’s method due to
    discontinuous nonlinearity in constitutive models.

    We apply the open-source simulator PFLOTRAN which employs a FV
    discretization and uses the PETSc parallel framework. We implement within
    PETSc the general-purpose nonlinear solver, Newton trust-region dogleg
    Cauchy (NTRDC) and Newton trust-region (NTR) to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of these advanced solvers. The results demonstrate speed-up
    compared to the default solvers of PETSc and complete simulations that were
    never completed with them.

.. _`Ashish Patel`:

.. topic:: *Ashish Patel*, Jeremy Theler, Francesc Levrero-Florencio, Nabil Abboud, Mohammad Sarraf Joshaghani, Scott McClennan, **Scalable cloud-native thermo-mechanical solvers using PETSc**

    This talk presents how the Ansys OnScale team uses PETSc to
    develop finite element-based thermo-mechanical solvers for scalable
    nonlinear simulations on the cloud. We will first provide an overview of
    features available in the solver and then discuss how some of the PETSc
    objects, like DMPlex and TS, have helped us speed up our development
    process. We will also talk about the workarounds we have incorporated to
    address the current limitations of some of the functions from DMPlex for
    our use cases involving multi-point constraints and curved elements.
    Finally, we demonstrate how PETSc’s linear solvers scale on multi-node
    cloud instances.

.. _`Spencer Patty`:

.. topic:: *Spencer Patty*, **Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library, what’s new and what’s next?**

    This talk provides an overview of Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)
    product and software for supporting optimized math routines for both Intel
    CPUs and GPUs.  Given that PETSc already utilizes several BLAS/LAPACK/Sparse
    BLAS routines from oneMKL for Intel CPU and as part of the Aurora project
    with Argonne, we discuss the use of OpenMP offload APIs for Intel GPUs.
    We explore software and hardware improvements for better sparse linear
    algebra performance and have an informal discussion of how to further
    support the PETSc community.

.. _`Marek Pecha`:

.. topic:: *Marek Pecha*, David Horak, Richard Tran Mills, Zachary Langford, **Distributed Machine Learning for Natural Hazard Applications Using PERMON**

    We will present a software solution for distributed machine learning
    supporting computation on multiple GPUs running on the top of the PETSc
    framework, which we will demonstrate in applications related to natural
    hazard localizations and detections employing supervised uncertainties
    modeling. It is called PERMON and is designed for convex optimization
    using quadratic programming, and its extension PermonSVM implements
    maximal-margin classifier approaches associated with support vector
    machines (SVMs). Although deep learning (DL) is getting popular in recent
    years, SVMs are still applicable. However, unlike DL, the SVM approach requires
    additional feature engineering or feature selection. We will present our
    workflow and show how to achieve reasonable models for the application
    related to wildfire localization in Alaska.

.. _`Joseph Pusztay`:

.. topic:: *Joseph Pusztay*, Matt Knepley, Mark Adams, **Landau Collisions in the Particle Basis with PETSc-PIC**

    The kinetic description of plasma encompasses the fine scale interaction of
    the various bodies that it is comprised of, and applies to a litany of
    experiments ranging from the laboratory magnetically confined fusion
    plasma, to the scale of the solar corona. Of great import to these
    descriptions are collisions in the grazing limit, which transfer momentum
    between components of the plasma. Until recently, these have best been
    described conservatively by finite element discretizations of the Landau
    collision integral. In recent years a particle discretization has been
    proven to preserve the appropriate eigenfunctions of the system, as well as
    physically relevant quantities. I present here the recent work on a purely
    particle discretized Landau collision operator which preserves mass,
    momentum, and energy,  with associated accuracy benchmarks in PETSc.

.. _`Jose E. Roman`:

.. topic:: *Jose E. Roman*, **Experiences in solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems with SLEPc**

    One of the unique features of SLEPc is the module for the general nonlinear
    eigenvalue problem (NEP), where we want to compute a few eigenvalues and
    corresponding eigenvectors of a large-scale parameter-dependent matrix
    T(lambda). In this talk, we will illustrate the use of NEP in the context
    of two applications, one of them coming from the characterization of
    resonances in nanophotonic devices, and the other one from a problem in
    aeroacoustics.

.. _`Barry Smith`:

.. topic:: *Barry Smith*, **Some thoughts on the future of PETSc**:

    How will PETSc evolve and grow in the future? How can PETSc algorithms and
    simulations be integrated into the emerging world of machine learning and
    deep neural networks? I will provide an informal discussion of these topics
    and my thoughts.

.. _`Tim Steinhoff`:

.. topic:: *Tim Steinhoff*, Volker Jacht, **Software Development and Deployment Including PETSc**

    Once it is decided that PETSc shall handle certain numerical subtasks in
    your software the question may arise about how to smoothly incorporate PETSc
    into the overall software development and deployment processes. In this
    talk, we present our approach how to handle such a situation for the code
    family AC2 which is developed and distributed by GRS. AC2 is used to
    simulate the behavior of nuclear reactors during operation, transients,
    design basis and beyond design basis accidents up to radioactive releases
    to the environment. The talk addresses our experiences, what challenges had
    to be overcome, and how we make use of GitLab, CMake, and Docker techniques
    to establish clean incorporation of PETSc into our software development
    cycle.

    Multiphysics models on large networks are used in many applications, for
    example, pore network models in reservoir simulation, epidemiological
    models of disease spread, ecological models on multispecies interaction,
    medical applications such as multiscale multidimensional simulations of
    blood flow, etc. This work presents the construction of the numerical
    upscaling and multiscale method for network models. An accurate
    coarse-scale approximation is generated by solving local problems in
    sub-networks. Numerical implementation of the network model is performed
    based on the PETSc DMNetwork framework. Results are presented for square
    and random heterogeneous networks generated by OpenPNM.

    Since 2000, we have been working on a finite-volume numerical framework
    “MultiFlow ” to predict multiphase flows in arbitrary domains by solving
    various flavors of the incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes
    equations using PETSc. This framework enables the simulation of creeping,
    laminar and turbulent flows with droplets and/or particles at various
    scales. It relies on a collocated variable arrangement of the unknown
    variables and momentum-weighted-interpolation to determine the fluxes at
    the cell faces to couple velocity and pressure. To maximize robustness, the
    governing flow equations are solved in a coupled fashion, i.e., as part of
    a single equation system involving all flow variables. Various modules are
    available within the code in addition to its core flow solver, allowing it to
    model interfacial and particulate flows at various flow regimes and scales.
    The framework heavily relies on the PETSc library not only to solve the
    system of governing equations but also for the handling of unknown
    variables, parallelization of the computational domain, and exchange of
    data over processor boundaries. We are now in the 3rd generation of our
    code, currently using a combination of DMDA, and DMPlex with DMForest/p4est
    frameworks to allow for the adaptive octree refinement of the
    computational mesh. In this contribution, we will present the details of
    the discretization and the parallel implementation of our framework and
    describe its interconnection with the PETSc library. We will then present
    some applications of our framework, simulating multiphase flows at various
    scales, flows regimes, and resolutions. During this contribution, we will
    also discuss our framework's challenges and future objectives.

.. topic:: *Matt Young*, **PETSc in the Ionosphere**

    A planet's ionosphere is the region of its atmosphere where a fraction
    of the constituent atoms or molecules have separated into positive ions and
    electrons. Earth's ionosphere extends from roughly 85 km during the day
    (higher at night) to the edge of space. This partially ionized regime
    exhibits collective behavior and supports electromagnetic phenomena that do
    not exist in the neutral (i.e., unionized) atmosphere. Furthermore, the
    abundance of neutral atoms and molecules leads to phenomena that do not
    exist in the fully ionized space environment. In a relatively narrow
    altitude range of Earth's ionosphere called the "E region", electrons
    behave as typical charged particles -- moving in response to combined
    electric and magnetic fields -- while ions collide too frequently with
    neutral molecules to respond to the magnetic field. This difference leads
    to the Farley-Buneman instability when the local electric field is strong
    enough. The Farley-Buneman instability regularly produces irregularities in
    the charged-particle densities that are strong enough to reflect radio
    signals. Recent research suggests that fully developed turbulent
    structures can disrupt GPS communication.

    The Electrostatic Parallel Particle-in-Cell (EPPIC) numerical simulation
    self-consistently models instability growth and evolution in the E-region
    ionosphere. The simulation includes a hybrid mode that treats electrons as
    a fluid and treats ions as particles. The particular fluid electron model
    requires the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation for the
    electrostatic potential at each time step, which we represent as a linear
    system that the simulation solves with PETSc. This presentation will
    describe the original development of the 2D hybrid simulation, previous
    results, recent efforts to extend to 3D, and implications for modeling GPS
    scintillation.

    We report the development of XGCm, a new distributed unstructured mesh
    gyrokinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code, short for x-point included
    gyrokinetic code mesh-based. The code adopts the physical algorithms of the
    well-established XGC code. It is intended as a testbed for experimenting
    with new numerical and computational algorithms, which can eventually be
    adopted in XGC and other PIC codes. XGCm is developed on top of several
    open-source libraries, including Kokkos, PETSc, Omega, and PUMIPic. Omega
    and PUMIPic rely on Kokkos to interact with the GPU accelerator, while
    PETSc solves the gyrokinetic Poisson equation on either CPU or GPU. We
    first discuss the numerical algorithms of our mesh-centric approach for
    performing PIC calculations. We then present a code validation study using
    the cyclone base case with ion temperature gradient turbulence (case 5 from
    Burckel, etc. Journal of Physics: Conference Series 260, 2010, 012006).
    Finally, we discuss the performance of XGCm and present weak scaling
    results using up to the full system (27,648 GPUs) of the Oak Ridge National
    Laboratory’s Summit supercomputer. Overall, XGCm executes all PIC
    operations on the GPU accelerators and exhibits good performance and
    portability.

    We present DMNetwork, a high-level set of routines included in the PETSc
    library for the simulation of multiphysics phenomena over large-scale
    networked systems. The library aims at applications with networked
    structures like those in electrical, water, and traffic
    distribution systems. DMNetwork provides data and topology management,
    parallelization for multiphysics systems over a network, and hierarchical
    and composable solvers to exploit the problem structure.  DMNetwork eases
    the simulation development cycle by providing the necessary infrastructure
    to define and query the network components through simple abstractions.

.. topic:: *Hui Zhou*, **MPI Multiply Threads**

    In the traditional MPI+Thread programming paradigm, MPI and OpenMP each
    form their own parallelization. MPI is unaware of the thread
    context. The requirement of thread safety and message ordering forces MPI
    library to blindly add critical sections, unnecessarily serializing the
    code. On the other hand, OpenMP cannot use MPI for inter-thread
    communications. Developers often need hand-roll algorithms for
    collective operations and non-blocking synchronizations.

    MPICH recently added a few extensions to address the root issues in
    MPI+Thread. The first extension, MPIX stream, allows applications to
    explicitly pass the thread context into MPI. The second extension, thread
    communicator, allows individual threads in an OpenMP parallel region to use
    MPI for inter-thread communications. In particular, this allows an OpenMP
    program to use PETSc within a parallel region.

    Instead of MPI+Thread, we refer to this new pattern as MPI x Thread.
