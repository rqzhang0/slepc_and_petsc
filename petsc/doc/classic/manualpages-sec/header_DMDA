# Structured Grids (DMDA)

The `DMDA` subclass of `DM` encapsulates a Cartesian structured mesh, with interfaces for both topology and geometry. It is capable of parallel refinement and coarsening.
Some support for parallel redistribution is available through the `PCTELESCOPE` object. A piecewise linear discretization is assumed for operations which require this information.
