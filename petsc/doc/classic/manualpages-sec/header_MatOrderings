# Matrix colorings (MatColoring), orderings (MatOrdering), partitionings (MatPartitioning), and coarsening (MatCoarsen)

These tools compute reorderings (`MatOrdering`) (for sparse matrix factorizations), colorings (`MatColoring`)
(for computing Jacobians via finite differences),  partitionings (`MatPartitioning`) (for parallel
decomposition of data), and coarsening (`MatCoarsen`) (for algebraic multigrid methods).
